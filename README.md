The Aetherise-Project is the result of a research,  
targeted to distinguish aether and spacetime.


The paper is published (preprint):  
[Hypothesis of a Violation of Lorentz Invariance in the Aether Theory and Confirmation by the Experiments of D. C. Miller](https://vixra.org/abs/2109.0142).

The Aetherise-Project consists of
- the tool *aetherise*
- the data sheets of Dayton C. Miller's experiments on top of Mount Wilson since 1925
- and various scripts to display the data using [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info)
