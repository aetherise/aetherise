### The Aetherise-Project

The Aetherise-Project is the result of a research,  
targeted to distinguish aether and spacetime.

The paper is published:  
[Hypothesis of a violation of Lorentz invariance in the aether theory and confirmation by the experiments of D. C. Miller](https://vixra.org/abs/2104.0040).

The Aetherise-Project consists of
- the tool *aetherise*
- the data sheets of Dayton C. Miller's experiments on top of Mount Wilson since 1925
- and various scripts to display the data using [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info)
